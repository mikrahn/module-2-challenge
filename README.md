## This application is a prototype of my professional portfolio url.

### The application consists of the following sections:

    1. Header with picture, developer name, site navigation, and a resume download option
    2. A personal information with a bit of my professional background
    3. A work / portfolio with links to my work
    4. A footer section with my contact information

Here is screenshot of my site:
